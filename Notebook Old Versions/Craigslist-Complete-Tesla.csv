This makes it very easy to wash the car, and things do not stick as they do to paint.  • Car has never been thru a carwash, has always been washed by hand.  • Car is rated at 4.4s 0-60 MPH, and is probably a little faster, as all Teslas usually exceed specifications (look it up on YouTube).  Yes, that's right, this is a VERY fast car, faster than a lot of ""sports"" cars out there, and that's when those cars hit launch control right.  This car?  Just push the pedal and hold on.  No drama, and can go again and again and again.  The car is amusement park fast.  • Suntek Ultra window tint all around, including one-piece rear window (the rear window is HUGE on this car, and only high end shops that know what they're doing can install it).  • Enhanced Auto Pilot (EAP).  This car drives itself!  Also parks itself.  And has Smart Summon. You continuously get free software updates which improve existing features (Autopilot drives better now than when the car was delivered), as well as free new features (the car now has dashcam functionality, for example, which it did not have when I purchased it -- it came via a free software update!).  • This car was purchased prior to the current free Autopilot, and it has features which are now part of the $7,000 ""Full Self Driving"" Package not included with the free Autopilot. The EAP Package cost $5000 + tax when the car was purchased and includes the following features (all of these features which are now part of the $7,000 FSD Package): 1. Autopilot -- this car has it 2. Navigate on Autopilot -- this car has it 3. Auto Lane Change -- this car has it 4. Autopark -- this car has it 5. Smart Summon -- this car has it  • A simple way to put it is that this car has all of the features of the $7,000 FSD package currently offered on all Teslas (the features listed above) that are functional today.  It will not get the actual Full Self Driving when that will be released, however that functionality is not currently functional; there is nothing functional today which you can purchase from Tesla that this car doesn't have.  • 20,000 miles -- has been used primarily for commuting by my wife.  Always garaged, virtually no supercharging -- we have an L2 240V/32A charger at home  • Custom 3D all-weather floor liners (cost ~$200)  • Tesla Model 3 Glass Roof Sunshade (cost $75 https://shop.tesla.com/product/model-3-glass-roof-sunshade)  • Gen 2 Mobile Connector with the now-extra charge NEMA 14-50 adapter! ($35 value, often out stock - https://shop.tesla.com/product/gen-2-nema-adapters -- pick 14-50)  • 100% accident free -- COMPLETELY CLEAN TITLE GUARANTEED!  One owner (us!).  • Under FULL FACTORY WARRANTY until September 2022 or 50,000 miles, whichever comes first (2 years 7 months/30,000 miles left as of now)  Serious inquiries only. Ask me anything.",,tx,33.0299,-96.7889

This was my first Tesla, a beautiful Model S 85 that costs $81knew in 2014 and was purchased directly from Tesla as a certified pre-owned vehicle in 2016 for $68k.   I believe the greatest advantage to owning the vehicle is it is still under warranty from the factory for the battery and drivetrain until 2022! Also, you will receive free unlimited SuperCharging and free data for navigation and entertainment/web browsing for as long as you own the vehicle and will still be able to transfer it to it's next loving owner. This vehicle also gets unlimited software updates which means that it actually becomes a BETTER vehicle over time.   One more thing, because it only has the super powerful rear performance motor, the front trunk space is gigantic! You can fit a hockey bag in the front trunk and still have room for more luggage. Mileage on an electric car is really not comparable to an internal combustion engine vehicle considering there are about 20, as opposed to about 2000 moving parts respectively.

I have the following vehicles for lease:  2013 Tesla Model S 85 Black - leased 2013 Tesla Model S 85 Silver - leased 2013 Tesla Model S 85 Green - leased 2013 Tesla Model S 85 Black - leased 2013 Tesla Model S 85 Red - available 3/14/20 2012 Tesla Model S Performance 85 silver - available now 2014 Tesla Model S Black - leased  Must be at least 21 years old. No credit check Free Application and Approval  The total due at lease signing is $420 security deposit plus the first weekly lease payment of $240 plus $16.80 tax for total of $676.80.  In addition to the weekly charge, you will pay $.18/mile up to 1000 miles per week. I do not charge for any miles above 1000 each week (up to 1600).  Why lease a Tesla?  You may just want to see if you like driving an EV and want to trial it.  If so, you can lease my Tesla for as few as 10 weeks and return it without any early termination fee.  You may not have the credit to go out and buy one because you haven't been on the job long enough yet or you are a contract worker doing rideshare. My high mileage lease offers you an opportunity to drive up to 1600 miles per week for a total of $420 plus tax of 7% which totals $449.40. This is less than 30 cents per mile!  Get better tips!  My Lessee's average make $2-3/hour more driving for Lyft and Uber because people love riding in aTesla.    Lease includes -Full use of the car for personal and rideshare use -Unlimited free Energy -All routine maintenance including tires/brakes  Stop using your vehicle and actually pay less per mile and earn more in a Tesla!   If you are just driving for a few months, you can get out of the lease in as little as 10 weeks WITHOUT ANY EARLY TERMINATION FEE!   Free application. Free Approval. Free On-boarding.  I pay plate/title/registration fees at BMV. Car will be registered and plated in your name. You can drive the car anywhere in the U.S. and you have full use of the car as you would with a lease from a dealership.    If you have the title to your car I will make you a reasonable offer to buy your car so you could be driving my Tesla as soon as tomorrow without any money out of your pocket by applying the amount I buy your car towards your security deposit and reduce your weekly lease payment.    Driver Requirements: You must be 21 Valid US driver's license You will need to secure your own auto insurance.  You might have heard of EVFleet as we previously rented the cars but now we are leasing them so they are titled/registered/plated to you.   Approval Process The approval process is quick and easy and completely FREE. Simply reply to this ad to start the process.  Support EVFleet also provides on-boarding to teach people how to operate the vehicles safely and efficiently and to maximize your revenue while working. We do this by providing information and tips on how to be successful driving for the on-demand community.   Cost per mile of lease if you drive 1500 miles per week:  $449.40/1500 miles = $.30 per mile  Here are the costs for driving YOUR car:  Gas is about $.10/mile $2.50 for 25 miles/gallon Depreciation is about $.10/mile Your car may be much higher Maintenance is about $.12/mile This includes oil changes/tires/brakes and major maintenance.  Total to drive fuel efficient car is $.32/mile. Your car may be even higher but you will make more as long as you drive more than 50 hours per week.   SO...it costs less than driving your car AND you earn up to $4 per hour more which means that in a 12 hour shift you should earn between $20 and $40 more than driving your car depending on what kind of vehicle you are currently driving.   Environmental Benefits Electric vehicles are very clean and great for the environment because they emit zero emissions. Teslas are completely electric which means that my Tesla vehicle will displace more than 3500 gallons of gasoline each year. By supporting the on-demand communities we are actually reducing the number of vehicles on the road. By having drivers share vehicles and by supporting the ride-sharing platforms less people need to use their own vehicle. So we are not just moving towards cleaner transport but also reducing the number of vehicles on our roads which reduces traffic and congestion.  EVFleet Indianapolis",,in,39.9559,-85.9601

I have the following vehicles for lease:  2013 Tesla Model S 85 Black - leased 2013 Tesla Model S 85 Silver - leased 2013 Tesla Model S 85 Green - leased 2013 Tesla Model S 85 Black - leased 2013 Tesla Model S 85 Red - available 3/7/20 2012 Tesla Model S Performance 85 silver - available 3/7 2014 Tesla Model S Black - leased  Must be at least 21 years old. No credit check Free Application and Approval  The total due at lease signing is $420 security deposit plus the first weekly lease payment of $240 plus $16.80 tax for total of $676.80.  In addition to the weekly charge, you will pay $.18/mile up to 1000 miles per week. I do not charge for any miles above 1000 each week (up to 1600).  Why lease a Tesla?  You may just want to see if you like driving an EV and want to trial it.  If so, you can lease my Tesla for as few as 10 weeks and return it without any early termination fee.  You may not have the credit to go out and buy one because you haven't been on the job long enough yet or you are a contract worker doing rideshare. My high mileage lease offers you an opportunity to drive up to 1600 miles per week for a total of $420 plus tax of 7% which totals $449.40. This is less than 30 cents per mile!  Get better tips!  My Lessee's average make $2-3/hour more driving for Lyft and Uber because people love riding in aTesla.    Lease includes -Full use of the car for personal and rideshare use -Unlimited free Energy -All routine maintenance including tires/brakes  Stop using your vehicle and actually pay less per mile and earn more in a Tesla!   If you are just driving for a few months, you can get out of the lease in as little as 10 weeks WITHOUT ANY EARLY TERMINATION FEE!   Free application. Free Approval. Free On-boarding.  I pay plate/title/registration fees at BMV. Car will be registered and plated in your name. You can drive the car anywhere in the U.S. and you have full use of the car as you would with a lease from a dealership.    If you have the title to your car I will make you a reasonable offer to buy your car so you could be driving my Tesla as soon as tomorrow without any money out of your pocket by applying the amount I buy your car towards your security deposit and reduce your weekly lease payment.    Driver Requirements: You must be 21 Valid US driver's license You will need to secure your own auto insurance.  You might have heard of EVFleet as we previously rented the cars but now we are leasing them so they are titled/registered/plated to you.   Approval Process The approval process is quick and easy and completely FREE. Simply reply to this ad to start the process.  Support EVFleet also provides on-boarding to teach people how to operate the vehicles safely and efficiently and to maximize your revenue while working. We do this by providing information and tips on how to be successful driving for the on-demand community.   Cost per mile of lease if you drive 1500 miles per week:  $449.40/1500 miles = $.30 per mile  Here are the costs for driving YOUR car:  Gas is about $.10/mile $2.50 for 25 miles/gallon Depreciation is about $.10/mile Your car may be much higher Maintenance is about $.12/mile This includes oil changes/tires/brakes and major maintenance.  Total to drive fuel efficient car is $.32/mile. Your car may be even higher but you will make more as long as you drive more than 50 hours per week.   SO...it costs less than driving your car AND you earn up to $4 per hour more which means that in a 12 hour shift you should earn between $20 and $40 more than driving your car depending on what kind of vehicle you are currently driving.   Environmental Benefits Electric vehicles are very clean and great for the environment because they emit zero emissions. Teslas are completely electric which means that my Tesla vehicle will displace more than 3500 gallons of gasoline each year. By supporting the on-demand communities we are actually reducing the number of vehicles on the road. By having drivers share vehicles and by supporting the ride-sharing platforms less people need to use their own vehicle. So we are not just moving towards cleaner transport but also reducing the number of vehicles on our roads which reduces traffic and congestion.  EVFleet Indianapolis",,in,39.9559,-85.9601

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

Brand new tires.   Has free supercharging for life.  Has free premium connectivity for life.   Replaced in 2019: Entire battery system, Electric motor, 17"" screen, MCU (computer & modem)  Blows away any 2012-2016 car w/out these upgrades,  difference is night and day.   Car was just fully inspected Feb 2020 by Tesla Costa Mesa and needs no service.   Certified Pre-owned 2012 Tesla S 85 with clean title, no accidents. 2nd owner, bought from Tesla late 2018.   Just under a full year of bumper to bumper Tesla factory warranty.  Only 63,000 miles, car is Tesla Certified and has full CPO warranty remaining. In addition, still has the Tesla powertrain warranty to Jan 2021.  Has air suspension, with 4 adjustable heights, and auto-raise memory.  Air suspension is vital in a model S, can't live without it.   Has dual chargers, to double your charging time at home, $2500 option Has free supercharging for life.  Has free premium connectivity for life.   Brand new entire battery system, replaced April 2019 (like a new car) Brand new motor Feb 2020 Brand new, updated (latest version) 17"" dash screen Brand new MCU with LTE 4G Brand new, updated latest version 2018 charging cable Brand new windshield $900. Entire car is fully tinted with high end 3M ceramic tint for sun protection, $900 Brand new Good Year tires $800  Car has no issues and is a tremendous value, especially with the brand new battery and new motor- All the performance, range and charging is like that of a brand new car.   This Model S is a gorgeous discontinued original gray color, which is deeper,  more dynamic and sharper looking that the current boring gray.   Interior is a light gray.    Original sticker included, price was $88,000.   A 2012 model S has a less soft ride than a new one, simply a more fun,  thrilling, connected feel. Feels more solid, even the seats are more solid, less soft.  The seats in newer Teslas are completely mushy.  I'm always glad to have my car back after the brand new loaner. They now use cheaper plastics as well.  Thankfully, no ""self driving"" features in this car.   I am the 2nd owner on this car and have only had this car for a year.   Car has no issues and is under full factory warranty for another year or 100,000 miles,  powertrain warranty into 2021 on motor and battery (bot of which are brand new).

This was my first Tesla, a beautiful Model S 85 that costs $81knew in 2014 and was purchased directly from Tesla as a certified pre-owned vehicle in 2016 for $68k.   I believe the greatest advantage to owning the vehicle is it is still under warranty from the factory for the battery and drivetrain until 2022! Also, you will receive free unlimited SuperCharging and free data for navigation and entertainment/web browsing for as long as you own the vehicle and will still be able to transfer it to it's next loving owner. This vehicle also gets unlimited software updates which means that it actually becomes a BETTER vehicle over time.   One more thing, because it only has the super powerful rear performance motor, the front trunk space is gigantic! You can fit a hockey bag in the front trunk and still have room for more luggage. Mileage on an electric car is really not comparable to an internal combustion engine vehicle considering there are about 20, as opposed to about 2000 moving parts respectively.
