I believe the greatest advantage to owning the vehicle is it is still under warranty from the factory for the battery and drivetrain until 2022! Also, you will receive free unlimited SuperCharging and free data for navigation and entertainment/web browsing for as long as you own the vehicle and will still be able to transfer it to it's next loving owner. This vehicle also gets unlimited software updates which means that it actually becomes a BETTER vehicle over time.   One more thing, because it only has the super powerful rear performance motor, the front trunk space is gigantic! You can fit a hockey bag in the front trunk and still have room for more luggage. Mileage on an electric car is really not comparable to an internal combustion engine vehicle considering there are about 20, as opposed to about 2000 moving parts respectively.
